                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing 
                        and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
                        the industry's standard dummy text ever since 
                        the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
                        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
                        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
                        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release 
                        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software 
                        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.    
                        Why do we use it?
                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be 
                        distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at 
                        its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that 
                        it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
                        as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
                        making it look like readable English. 
                        Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now 
                        use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 
                        'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
                        Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
                        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
